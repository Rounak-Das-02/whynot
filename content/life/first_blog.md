I’ve been bored for as long as I can remember. Not the _"I have nothing to do"_ kind of boredom, but the _existential, nothing-is-exciting-enough_ type. The kind where you have tons of ideas, but taking action feels like too much effort.

And yet, here I am, **starting a blog**.

Why?

{{< quote style="2" author="Rounak" designation="I don't care" >}}
WHY NOT ? WTF ?
{{< /quote >}}

Honestly… **why not?**

For the longest time, I thought about writing, but I kept pushing it aside. "Maybe later," "Who even reads blogs anymore?" and my favorite excuse—"Meh, too much effort." But recently, I realized something: **I am always going to be bored.** So, instead of waiting for that to change, I might as well write through it.

So, welcome to my **bored guy's blogging journey.**

## Why This Blog Exists (Against All Odds)

There’s a part of me that enjoys writing. But there’s also a bigger, louder part of me that says:

- "Who cares about what I write?"
- "Isn’t the internet already full of blogs?"
- "Will I even be consistent?"

Well, here’s the thing—I don’t have answers to these questions.

What I _do_ know is that **I needed to start**. Whether it’s because I finally mustered the energy or just ran out of excuses, it doesn’t matter. The point is, **this blog exists now.**

What will I write about? That’s a fantastic question. I wish I had a fantastic answer.

## What You Can Expect Here

Since I don’t want to box myself into a single niche, this blog will be a **chaotic mix of whatever I feel like writing about**:

### 1. **Tech, DevOps, and My Work Life**

Let’s be real—I spend a lot of time working on **servers, Kubernetes, databases, and monitoring tools**. So, expect posts where I rant (or maybe share something useful) about **DevOps, automation, cloud infra, and random debugging stories.**

### 2. **Life, Rants, and Observations**

Sometimes I just have thoughts. You know, the kind that randomly pop up while you’re waiting for a CI/CD pipeline to deploy. Thoughts on life, work, motivation (or lack thereof), and the small things that make existing amusing.

### 3. **Food, Travel, and Random Adventures**

I love good food, and I travel sometimes. When I do, I might just write about it. Maybe restaurant reviews? Maybe **“The Best Biriyani I’ve Ever Had”**? Who knows.

### 4. **The Struggle of a Bored Guy Trying to Do Things**

This will probably be the most recurring theme—**me, trying to do things.** Whether it’s setting up my own blog, learning something new, or attempting to be productive, I’ll document the journey.

## Will I Stick to This?

Ah, the golden question. Will this blog last?

I have no idea.

Maybe this will be my **first and last post**. Maybe I’ll become one of those people who posts every week. Maybe I’ll disappear for months and come back randomly. All I know is that I’ve **started**, and that’s already more than I thought I’d do.

For now, let’s just take it post by post.

## Final Thoughts

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations—you’ve just read the very first post on this blog. Not bad, right?

I have no grand vision here. No promises, no pressure—just words on a page, thoughts on the internet, and a bored guy trying to write.

Let’s see where this goes.

### Until next time (whenever that is).
